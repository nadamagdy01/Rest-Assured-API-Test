# Rest Assured API Automation

This project involves automating tests for the Booking API using Java, Rest Assured, and TestNG. The tests cover scenarios such as validating authentication responses, booking creation, and checking the list of bookings. The following document provides an overview of the setup, execution, and required deliverables.

## Overview

This document provides detailed instructions for automating tests for the Booking API. The tests cover various scenarios to ensure the correct functionality of the API endpoints.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Java**: Programming language for writing the test scripts.
- **Rest Assured**: Library for API testing and validation.
- **TestNG**: Testing framework for organizing and executing test cases.
- **Extent/Allure Reports**: Reporting tools for generating test execution reports.

## Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Verify Authentication Token

**Objective**: Ensure that the authentication response is not empty and that a token is successfully generated.

**API Endpoint**:
- **URL**: `https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/auth`
- **Method**: POST

**Request Details**:
- **Headers**: Content-Type: application/json
- **Body**: JSON payload containing username and password

**Expected Response**:
- **Status Code**: 200 OK
- **Body**: JSON with a token field

### Scenario 2: Verify Booking Creation

**Objective**: Ensure that a booking is successfully created and verify the response data.

**API Endpoint**:
- **URL**: `https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/booking`
- **Method**: POST

**Request Details**:
- **Headers**: Content-Type: application/json
- **Body**: JSON payload with booking details such as firstname, lastname, totalprice, depositpaid, bookingdates, and additionalneeds

**Expected Response**:
- **Status Code**: 200 OK
- **Body**: JSON with bookingid and booking details

### Scenario 3: Verify List of Bookings

**Objective**: Ensure that the list of bookings retrieved by ID is greater than zero.

**API Endpoint**:
- **URL**: `https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/booking`
- **Method**: GET

**Request Details**:
- Retrieve all bookings and check the list count.

**Expected Validation**:
- Assert that the number of bookings in the response is greater than zero.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **Java JDK**: Ensure Java Development Kit (JDK) is installed on your system.
2. **Maven**: Install Maven for dependency management and test execution.
3. **IntelliJ IDEA**: Install IntelliJ IDEA or any other preferred Java IDE.
4. **Rest Assured**: Add Rest Assured dependency in your `pom.xml` for API testing.
5. **TestNG**: Add TestNG dependency in your `pom.xml` for test execution.

### Steps to Run the Tests

1. **Clone the Repository**
   git clone <https://github.com/nadamagdy01/Rest-Assured-API-Test/tree/master>

2. **Setup Project in IntelliJ IDEA**

Open IntelliJ IDEA.
Import the project as a Maven project.
Ensure all dependencies are resolved as per the pom.xml.

3. **Configure Test Data**

Ensure that the test data (e.g., JSON files) is ready and correctly placed in the project directory.

4. **Run Tests**
mvn test

5. **Generate Reports**

Review the generated test reports (Extent/Allure).
Reports will be available in the designated reports directory.
## Deliverables
#### Demo Video: A recorded video demonstrating the execution of the tests.

#### Execution Report: An HTML report generated by Extent/Allure showing the results of the test execution.

#### ReadMe File: Contains the setup, execution steps, and tools used for the automation.
